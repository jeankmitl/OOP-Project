# Defense of the Dungeon

This project is part of Object-Oriented Programming course @ School of Information Technology, KMITL

## üìì Description

A Tower Defense game that will allow players to think, plan, and adjust strategies to overcome obstacles that players will encounter, which was inspired by the games Plants vs Zombies and Arknights. The main gameplay will be placing units to protect our base from waves of enemies that invade. We will have to manage Mana to place units and study the capabilities of units and the abilities of each enemy to overcome various levels and get new units to use to challenge the next level
