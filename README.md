# Defense of the Dungeon

This project is part of Object-Oriented Programming course @ School of Information Technology, KMITL

## üìì Description

A Tower Defense video game in 2025, developed and published by Game Name. It was first released on GitHub, where players take on the role of a Dungeon Master, defending against the invasion of the Tomb Raider. When a Tomb Raider enters a dungeon, players must defend their dungeon by placing monsters that will attack the Tomb Raider or block the Tomb Raider from passing. The Tomb Raider can also defeat monsters. Players must also gather energy called Mana to summon monsters. If the Tomb Raider reaches the entrance of the dungeon, the player loses the game
